# Habesha Dates

Habesha Dates is a Flutter mobile application for Ethiopian/Eritrean date conversion and cultural calendar features. It integrates with Firebase for authentication, storage, and real-time data, and targets Android, iOS and Web platforms.

## Key Features
- Convert dates between Gregorian and Ethiopian calendars
- User authentication with Firebase Auth (email, Google Sign-In)
- Store user preferences and app data in Cloud Firestore
- Upload and serve images with Firebase Storage
- Local persistence for offline data with `sqflite`
- Image capture and selection using `image_picker`

## Screenshots
Add app screenshots in the `assets/` or `docs/` folder and reference them here.

## Tech Stack
- Flutter (Dart)
- Firebase: Auth, Firestore, Storage
- Plugins: `cloud_firestore`, `firebase_auth`, `firebase_core`, `firebase_storage`, `google_sign_in`, `image_picker`, `sqflite`

## Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (stable channel) installed and configured
- Android SDK (for Android builds)
- Xcode (for iOS builds, macOS only)
- A Firebase project with Android / iOS / Web apps configured

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository

	 git clone <repo-url>
	 cd habesha_dates

2. Install dependencies

	 flutter pub get

3. Configure Firebase

	 - Android: place `google-services.json` into `android/app/` (already present in this repo for convenience under `android/app/google-services.json`).
	 - iOS: download `GoogleService-Info.plist` and add it to `ios/Runner` in Xcode.
	 - Web: follow Firebase console steps and add config to your web entry if needed.

	 The generated Firebase options for Dart are in [lib/firebase_options.dart](lib/firebase_options.dart#L1).

4. Run the app

	 - Android emulator / device:

		 flutter run -d emulator-5554

	 - iOS (macOS):

		 flutter run -d <device-id>

	 - Web:

		 flutter run -d web-server

## Build Release

- Android (APK):

	flutter build apk --release

- iOS (App Store):

	flutter build ipa

## Environment & Firebase Notes
- The repository includes `lib/firebase_options.dart` which is generated by `flutterfire` CLI. If you need to regenerate:

	1. Install `flutterfire` CLI: `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`
	2. Run: `flutterfire configure --project <firebase-project-id>`

- Ensure `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) are present for the corresponding platform builds.

## Project Structure
- `lib/` — main application source
	- `main.dart` — app entry point ([lib/main.dart](lib/main.dart#L1))
	- `firebase_options.dart` — Firebase config generated by `flutterfire`
	- `core/`, `features/`, `shared/` — domain and feature code
- `android/`, `ios/`, `web/`, `windows/`, `linux/`, `macos/` — platform folders

## Testing

- Run unit/widget tests:

	flutter test

## CI / Code Quality
- Add CI workflows (GitHub Actions) to run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` on PRs.

## Contributing
- Fork the repo, create a feature branch, and open a Pull Request.
- Keep changes small and focused; include tests for new logic.

## Common Tasks
- Upgrade dependencies:

	flutter pub upgrade

- Clean build artifacts:

	flutter clean

## Troubleshooting
- If you get Firebase-related runtime errors, ensure the platform-specific Firebase config files are present and `lib/firebase_options.dart` matches your Firebase project.
- For Android build issues, verify `compileSdkVersion` and Gradle plugin versions in `android/` match the recommended Flutter versions.
